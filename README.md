# Dynamic Concolication for Automatic Unit Testing

This repository contains the implementation of our research on using PyCT to enhance concolic testing for Python libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started with running the code, you can begin with `coverage_ray/transformers/unittest_any.py`. This script serves as the entry point for executing the concolic testing process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyCT
- Other dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`
